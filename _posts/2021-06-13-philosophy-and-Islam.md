I didnt plan on starting my first blog here on a serious topic lmao but this is what I was thinking right now so...

By no means am i an expert on philosophy or in Islam. I have been reading a lot of philosophical ideas by some very notable names in the human history, and being a Muslim I can't help myself relating my beliefs to the philosophical ideas i'm reading.

---
I have to say this. There's an extreme level of similarities between the philosophical ideas that i've been reading (ill share in the future) and Islamic faith. 

---

these similarites are so amazing that often times i think that why or how did the islamic message did not reach these people, these great minds. Because if it had reached, they would have made a statement of some sort that hey! this religion talks about what we have thought. The other thought that comes along is even scarier. That if the message didn't get to them and they came up with these ideas just by them thinking. HOW were they able to reach "that" level of thinking.

anyways. im ending here, this was just something I wanted to write down. I might write more about this and share my ideas here.
