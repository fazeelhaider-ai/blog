When I think of my childhood, most part of it was my mother telling me to study. I got used to studying like it was just the absolute right thing for me to do at that point. It became the everyday primary action of my life. Studying, day and night. These was a problem though. I was bad at it. I wasn't good at all in school. I was always focused on playing may more than studying, but the primary action still remained studying even though I was good at sports. Eventually, it became a habit and I'd just have my books open for no reason. To my mind, I was studying (because it's the right thing to do)

Overall, I think that was a bad way of looking at acquiring knowledge but idk I think it worked out? in some way. More on this at some time later...

So I climbed the steps from grade 1 - 11. During the process, changed 7-8 schools and 2 colleges. Came to United States in 2015 and attended senior year of highschool in here for 6 months. Pause here. 
Now, after graduating highschool. There was this thing in my mind, a question of "what now?". Because idk why, for some reason I thought going to a university in States is the hardest and most expensive thing to do and I won't be able to afford that. But I got into a college and picked up a major and starting "studying" again. Now, I was at peace because again I was studying now (which is the right thing for me to do, to my mind).

The only thing on my mind now is to complete the University. I couldn't care less about anything else lmao. I just have to get a degree, that's it. Which was the wrong mindset, but lets talk about that some other day.

Fast forward, I graduated from University in 2021 and now that phase of "what now?" hits like a truck. I am completely lost, and constantly asking myself what now? studying was THE only process I knew. What now?. This was the most weird period of my life. I'm 21 btw. I had no clue what to do and no direction. Looking at other people's life after graduating. Everyone was getting a job so I did the same, started applying for jobs. OK, of course I had to get a job. It's not like I wasn't thinking about getting a job. But I was systematically trained to follow a guideline all my life, now that guidline suddenly changed from studying books 14 hours a day to start applying for jobs. This sudden shift of the process was I scared about. Let me remind you again, I wasn't good at studying lmao. Studying for me was opening books infront of me for hours and paying attention and actually learn something 30 minutes. Kinda like that. Anyways, this what now? phases in my life were 'different'. Each time I thought about, is this really what life is about? and questions like what is life?.

Was it worth it to study all the time, being extremely stressed about every single test because I do not want to disapoint my parents / make them feel hopeless about my "successful" future. Thinking 10 times before I'm going to play a game once in like a month, "maybe I should spend this time studying idk". Yeah, it got to my head. Studying was right and everything was wrong. That was the mindset I was in. You'd think I would be the next Albert Einstein. Nah, I wasn't good at all.

So yeah, was it worth it in the end?
My answer is I don't know. I just don't know. I'm still trying to understand what is life. It doesn't feel wrong but it took a lot away in some ways. But its not bad now. Understand what I'm saying?

hopefully, I'm prepared for the next "what now" phase. InshAllah.
