I'm sure many of you care about someone in your lives. maybe not just one person, perhaps a bunch of people. Maybe its your family you really care about. Maybe it's your family and friends you really care about. Maybe you care about just your friends. Whatever it is. You must have, at some point, feared for their life. 

Say this person you care about, leaves the house and you are worried about them. You are actually afraid that they could get hurt. Well, they could get hurt inside the house too but you're mainly afraid of the outside threat. In this blog, I'm gonna talk about this outside threat impacting lives of our loved ones.

I often think what can we do about this outside threat. It gives me a lot of anxiety because I can't do anything about it. The only thing I can do is pray for them and their safety. I do not think praying is useless (astagfirullah) but if death is written for someone, it won't delay. And that is very sad to think about. And also, if your'e thirsty, you don't just pray that water fills up in your tummy and quench your thirst. You get up and find water while you pray for it.

Anyways, the point is that you can not deal with death. It's inevitable. I will write more about death on some other day inshAllah. 

BTW, I wrote the first two paragraphs on 16th June and wrote the rest of it on 23rd June. I'm so bad at focusing on task at hand these days :((.
